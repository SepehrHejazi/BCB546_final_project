### Create a list of data frames to merge
df_list <- list(df1, df2, df3, df4, df5, df6, df7, df8, df9, df10, df11, df12, df13, df14, df15)

### Define the common column to merge on
Sequences <- "sequence"

### Merge data frames

merged_df <- df_list[[1]]

  merged_df <- Reduce(function(x, y) merge(x, y, by = Sequences), list(merged_df, df_list[[i]]))}
